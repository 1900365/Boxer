//BXGamebox represents a single Boxer gamebox and offers methods for retrieving and persisting
//bundled drives, configuration files and documentation. It is based on NSBundle but does not
//require that Boxer gameboxes use any standard OS X bundle folder structure.
//(and indeed, gameboxes with an OS X bundle structure haven't been tested.)

//TODO: it is inappropriate to subclass NSBundle for representing a modifiable file package,
//and we should instead be using an NSFileWrapper directory wrapper.
