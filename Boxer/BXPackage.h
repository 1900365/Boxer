//BXPackage represents a single Boxer gamebox and offers methods for retrieving and persisting
//bundled drives, configuration files, documentation and target programs. It is based on NSBundle
//but does not require that Boxer gameboxes use any standard OS X bundle folder structure.
//(and indeed, gameboxes with a standard OS X bundle structure haven't been tested.)

//TODO: it is inappropriate to subclass NSBundle for representing a modifiable file package,
//and we should instead be using an NSFileWrapper directory wrapper.
