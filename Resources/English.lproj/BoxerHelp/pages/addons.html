		<h1>Installing a game expansion or add-on</h1>
		
		<p>Some MS-DOS games received official expansion packs, which usually came on their own diskettes or CD-ROMs and require separate installation. To install an expansion:</p>
			
		<ol class="steps">
			<li><strong>Launch the original game while holding down <kbd>Opt ⌥</kbd></strong> to start it up at the DOS prompt.<li>
			
			<li>
				<p><strong>Add the expansion as a new DOS drive</strong>, by doing one of the following:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>If the expansion is a physical CD:</strong> insert the CD into your Mac’s DVD drive.</li>
				<li><strong>If the expansion is a disc image:</strong> double-click on it to mount it as an OS X volume.</li>
				<li><strong>If the expansion is a folder of install files:</strong> drag it into the DOS window.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>Browse the expansion’s files in Finder to <strong>locate the installer program for the expansion</strong>: usually <span class="filename">install.exe</span>, <span class="filename">setup.exe</span> or similar.</li>
			
			<li><p><strong>Double-click on the installer program in Finder</strong> to launch it in DOS. Follow the installer’s instructions to complete the installation.</p>
				<p class="tip"><strong>If the installer asks for the location of the original game</strong>, enter the path on drive C in which the original game was installed: e.g. “C:\GAMENAME”. If you’re not sure, <a href="gameboxes.html#gameboxes-exploring" rel="topic">browse the gamebox in Finder</a> to locate the game’s folder.</p></li>

			<li><p><strong>If the expansion came on a CD-ROM or disc image</strong>, it may require its own CD as a copy protection measure. To ensure the expansion can always find its CD, you should <a href="drives.html#bundling-drives" rel="topic">import the CD into the gamebox</a> and familiarize yourself with <a href="swapping-cds.html#swapping-queued-cds" rel="topic">how to swap CDs while playing</a>.</p></li>
		</ol>
