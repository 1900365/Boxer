				<h3>To add a drive to DOS:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><strong>If you have a physical CD, insert it into your Mac’s DVD drive</strong>. Boxer will add it automatically to DOS.</p>
						
						<p>Boxer will do likewise when you insert a 3.5" floppy disk into a USB floppy drive connected to your Mac.</p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<p><strong>If you have a folder or disc image, drag it into the game window or the Drives Inspector.</strong> Boxer will add it as a new drive of the appropriate type (hard disk for regular folders, CD-ROM or floppy disk for disc images).</p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<p><strong>If you need more control over the drive type and letter</strong>, click the <img src="../shared/images/add-drive-button.png" alt="+" width="41" height="22" style="vertical-align: bottom"> button on the Drives Inspector: this will bring up a file picker with advanced drive options.</p>
					</li>

				<h3>To swap between CDs/floppies:</h3>
				
				<p>When you add extra CDs or floppies, they will <strong>go into a queue with any previous CD/floppy</strong>, using the same drive letter. This ensures the game will always find its discs at the right place.</p>
				
				<p>You can then swap between each CD/floppy in a queue:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Go to <span class="menu">Emulation ▸ Next Disc</span> to cycle through all the CDs/floppies in the queue; or</li>
					<li>Go to the Drives Inspector and <strong>double-click a specific CD/floppy</strong> to swap to it.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="note"><strong>If you want to have CDs/floppies on separate drive letters</strong> — e.g. one floppy at drive A and another at drive B — then <strong>add the drives manually with the <img src="../shared/images/add-drive-button.png" alt="+" width="41" height="22" style="vertical-align: bottom"> button</strong> as described above.</p>

				<h3>To remove a drive from DOS:</h3>
				
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Drag the drive out of the Drives Inspector</strong> until the cursor changes to a puff of smoke, and then release it. The drive will be removed from DOS and will disappear from the list.</p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<p><strong>If you just want to temporarily disable a drive</strong>, then <strong>select the drive and click the <img src="../shared/images/eject-drive-button.png" alt="Eject" style="vertical-align: middle"> button</strong>: this removes the drive from DOS but leaves it in the drive list. To re-enable the drive, <strong>double-click the drive or click the <img src="../shared/images/insert-drive-button.png" alt="Eject" style="vertical-align: middle"> button</strong>.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Bundling additional drives into a gamebox</h2>
			
			<p>Each of your gameboxes contains a drive C for the hard disk where the game is installed, and often a drive D for the game’s CD-ROM. Because they’re part of the gamebox, <strong>these drives are always available in DOS when you run the game.</strong></p>
			
			<p>If you want additional drives to be always available to the game — for instance, extra CDs for a multi-CD game — <strong>then you can bundle them into the gamebox</strong> too:</p>
			
			<ol class="steps">
				<li><strong>Add the drive to DOS</strong> if it isn’t already, by following the <a href="#adding-drives">instructions above</a>.</li>
				
				<li>In the Drives Inspector, <strong>select the drive and click on the <img src="../shared/images/bundle-drive-button.png" alt="CD sliding into box" style="vertical-align: middle"> icon</strong>; or, right-click on the drive and choose <span class="menu">Import into Gamebox</span>.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Make a cup of tea</strong> while the drive imports.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Once the import is finished, the drive will be a permanent part of the gamebox and always there when you run the game.</p>
			
			<p class="note">The import process will <strong>physically copy the drive’s contents into the gamebox</strong>, creating a duplicate of the original folder or image used for the drive. You don’t need to keep the original around after this.</p>
