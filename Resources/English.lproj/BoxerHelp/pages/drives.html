			<p>Press <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> to bring up the <a href="help:runscript=BoxerHelp/shared/scripts/openinspector.scpt string='Drives'" rel="application-window">Drives Inspector</a>. This panel shows what drives are currently available in DOS, and lets you add and remove drives.</p>

			<h3>To add a drive to DOS:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>If you have a CD-ROM, insert it into your Mac's DVD drive</strong>. Boxer will add it automatically to DOS as a new CD-ROM drive at the next available drive letter.</p>
					
					<p>Boxer will do likewise when you insert a 3.5" floppy disk into a USB floppy drive connected to your Mac.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p><strong>If you have a folder or disc image, drag it into the Drives panel.</strong> Boxer will add it as a new drive of the appropriate type (hard disk for regular folders, CD-ROM or floppy disk for disc images), at the next available drive letter.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p><strong>If you need more control over the drive type and letter</strong>, then press the <img src="../shared/images/add-drive-button.png" alt="+" width="42" height="22" style="vertical-align: bottom"> button on the Drives Inspector to bring up a file picker with advanced drive options.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>To remove a drive from DOS:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Drag the drive out of the Drives Inspector</strong> until the cursor changes to a puff of smoke, and then release it.</li>
				
				<li>You can also <strong>select the drive and click the <img src="../shared/images/eject-drive-button.png" alt="-" width="38" height="22" style="vertical-align: bottom"> button</strong>. But that’s not quite as fun.</li>

			<h2>Bundling a drive into a gamebox</h2>
			
			<p>When running a <a href="gameboxes.html" rel="topic">gamebox</a>, the Drives Inspector will display a drive C for the hard disk where your game is installed, and often a drive D for any CD-ROM the game had. These drives are stored inside the gamebox, and always available in DOS when you run the game.</p>
			
			<p><strong>If you want additional drives to be always available to the game</strong>, you can bundle them into the gamebox too:</p>
			
			<ol class="steps">
				<li><strong>Add the drive to DOS</strong> by following the <a href="#adding-drives">instructions above</a>.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Right-click on the drive</strong> in the Drives Inspector and choose <span class="menu">Import into gamebox</span>.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p class="note">This process will physically copy the drive’s contents into the gamebox, creating a duplicate of the folder or image originally used for the drive. You don’t need to keep the original around after this.</p>
