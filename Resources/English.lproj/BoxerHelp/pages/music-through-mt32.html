		<h1>Playing music through your MT-32</h1>
		
		<p>If you’re lucky enough to have a real <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_MT-32" rel="external">Roland MT-32 Sound Module</a> and a USB-to-MIDI adapter, then you can play DOS game music through it. This will provide much better music in games that were composed for it.</p>
		
		<h3>To make a game use your MT-32:</h3>
		
		<ol class="steps">
			<li>Connect your MT-32 to your Mac using a USB-to-MIDI adapter, and turn it on.</li>
			<li>Open the game’s <a href="dosbox-configuration.html" rel="topic">DOSBox Configuration file</a>.</li>
			<li>Paste the following lines into the configuration file:
				<pre class="code-example"><code>[midi]
mididevice=coremidi
midiconfig=0 delaysysex</code></pre>
			</li>
			<li>If the game has a sound setup utility, run it before playing and choose the MT-32 as the music device.</li>
			<li>Start up the game and enjoy the rich, vibrant music pouring out of your expensive music hardware.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p class="note">You will need to do these steps for each game that you want to play through the MT-32: otherwise the game’s MIDI music will be sent through OS X’s builtin MIDI synth instead.</p>
		
		<p class="tip"><em>If you have a later-model MT-32 with a headphone jack, you can remove the <code>delaysysex</code> flag to reduce game loading times.</em> This flag delays MIDI signals and is only necessary for older MT-32 models, which would otherwise miss custom instruments (or stop playing altogether) if the game sends signals too fast.</p>
