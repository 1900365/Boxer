			<p>If a program exits immediately at startup saying:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>“<samp>This program cannot be run in DOS mode.</samp>”</li>
				<li>“<samp>This program must be run under Win32</samp>”</li>
				<li>“<samp>Unknown command or file name: win</samp>”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>…or similar, this means that <strong>the program is Microsoft Windows-only</strong> and cannot run in DOS.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Boxer can only emulate MS-DOS programs</strong>, and will usually detect and warn you if you try to start a Windows program or import a Windows-only game.</p>

			<h2>Alternatives for Windows emulation</h2>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxgames/" rel="external">Crossover Games</a> is a good alternative for running Windows-only games. It has a similar workflow to Boxer, and allows you to install and play many Windows games without needing a copy of Windows itself.</p>
			
			<p>Another option is a virtualization suite such as <a href="http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/" rel="external">Parallels Desktop</a> or <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/" rel="external">VMWare Fusion</a>. These let you install and run Windows within a virtual machine on your Mac, and thus require you to have a copy of Windows.</p>

			<h2>But I thought this <em>was</em> a DOS game!</h2>
			<p>Many PC games around the 1995–1997 transitional era were released for both MS-DOS <em>and</em> Windows: sometimes as completely separate products, and sometimes as both versions in a single installation.</p>
			
			<p>If you encounter a Windows program, it’s worth trying other programs in the same folder to see if they work in DOS. Unfortunately, since DOS and Windows programs both use the <span class="filename">.exe</span> extension, you can only tell by trying to run them.</p>
			
			<p class="note">Boxer’s <a href="help:runscript=BoxerHelp/shared/scripts/import.scpt string='null'" rel="application-window">game importer</a> weeds out Windows-only installers and will only offer actual DOS installers to choose from. And if the importer says the whole game is Windows-only, that means it really is.</p>
