# This configuration file was created by Boxer.
# It decreases conventional memory to prevent crashes in
# Wing Commander 2.

# Several commonly-needed DOSBox settings are given below,
# disabled by default. To enable a setting, remove the #
# character from the beginning of its line.


[sdl]
#autolock=true
## -----------
## Lock the mouse cursor when you click on the DOS window,
## preventing it from leaving the window at the edges.
## You can also toggle this manually by Option-clicking.


[cpu]
#cycles=
## -----------
## The setting above will be uncommented and filled in
## by Boxer whenever you adjust the CPU speed with
## Cmd-Up/Cmd-Down. This way, your speed settings
## are saved and used the next time you play.

#cycles=auto 5000
## -----------
## Default automatic CPU speed, suitable for most games.

#cycles=max
## -----------
## Force maximum CPU speed. Improves performance in newer
## games, but will cause older games to run too fast.

#cycles=1000
## -----------
## Slow down CPU speed to the level of an 8MHz 286.
## Needed for older games that run too fast otherwise.

#core=dynamic
## -----------
## Force advanced CPU emulation for demanding games.
## DOSBox will usually detect when a game needs this
## setting and turn it on automatically.
## Note: core=dynamic has no effect on PowerPC Macs.


[joystick]
#joysticktype=none
## -----------
## Disable joystick emulation. Needed for games that try
## to calibrate the joystick when one is not present.

#joysticktype=fcs
## -----------
## Emulate a Thrustmaster Flight Control Stick.

#joysticktype=ch
## -----------
## Emulate a CH Flightstick.


[autoexec]
## Any DOS commands you put underneath this heading
## will be executed when DOS emulation starts.

call loadfix -f
call loadfix -10
## -----------
## Reduce the amount of conventional memory available.
## (Loadfix -f frees any memory from a previous loadfix call first.)
