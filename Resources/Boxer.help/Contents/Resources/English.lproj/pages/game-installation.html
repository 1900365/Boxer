		<p class="tip">Always install games by dropping them onto the <a href="x-help-script://net.washboardabs.boxer.help/../shared/scripts/import.scpt?" rel="application-window">Import window</a> or “Import a new game” droplet.<br>
		This will run the game’s installer if necessary, and bundle the game into a new <a href="gameboxes.html">gamebox</a>.</p>

			<a name="install-location"></a>
			<h2>Telling the game where to install</h2>
		
			<p><strong>Choose any location on drive C</strong>. The path within drive C doesn’t matter, so use whatever the game suggests.</p>
			
			<p class="note">When importing a game, Boxer creates an empty drive C inside a new <a href="gameboxes.html">gamebox</a>.<br>
			Installing to drive C will put the game files directly into the gamebox, where they belong.</p>

			<a name="install-size"></a>
			<h2>Choosing an install size</h2>
			<p>Many CD-ROM games offer a choice of installation sizes, where smaller installations leave more data on the CD.</p>
			
			<p><strong>For most games you should choose the smallest install size</strong>, because Boxer will import the whole CD into the gamebox regardless. A larger install size wastes disk space and will have no effect on loading times.</p>
			
			<p class="note">Some games disable features or leave out content at smaller installation sizes.<br>
			You should choose the maximum size for those games.</p>

			<h2>Choosing a sound card</h2>
			
			<p>Many games will happily <strong>autodetect the correct sound card settings</strong>. If you need to choose a sound card manually, then Boxer supports the following:</p>
			
			<section>
				<a name="sound-blaster"></a>
				<h3>Sound Blaster/Pro/16</h3>
				<p>The most reliable choice and supported by almost all games. Choose Sound Blaster 16 if available, otherwise Pro or regular Sound Blaster. Use the following settings if asked:</p>
				
				<table class="sound-configuration">
					<tr><th>I/O Address:</th><td>220</td></tr>
					<tr><th>IRQ:</th><td>7</td></tr>
					<tr><th>DMA:</th><td>1</td></tr>
				</table>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<a name="general-midi"></a>
				<h3>General MIDI <small>(“MPU-401 compatible”)</small></h3>
				<p>This provides high-quality music (better than <a href="#sound-blaster">Sound Blaster</a>) and is supported by most later DOS games. If the game lets you choose separate soundcards for digital audio and music, choose <strong>Sound Blaster 16 for digital audio</strong> and <strong>General MIDI for music</strong>.</p>
				
				<table class="sound-configuration">
					<tr><th>I/O Address:</th><td>330</td></tr>
				</table>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<a name="gravis-ultrasound"></a>
				<h3>Gravis Ultrasound/Max <small>(“GUS”)</small></h3>
				<p>Not widely supported: but in games that properly support it, this can provide more channels of digital audio and better sampled music than <a href="#sound-blaster">Sound Blaster</a> or <a href="#general-midi">General MIDI</a>.</p>
				
				<p class="note">If the game’s music card option is labelled “Gravis Ultrasound MIDI synth” then it doesn’t provide native Gravis Ultrasound music, and you should choose <a href="#general-midi">General MIDI</a> instead.</p>
				
				<table class="sound-configuration">
					<tr><th>I/O Address:</th><td>240</td></tr>
					<tr><th>IRQ:</th><td>5</td></tr>
					<tr><th>DMA:</th><td>3</td></tr>
				</table>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<a name="adlib"></a>
				<h3>AdLib</h3>
				<p>This music-only card was supported by many older games. You should choose <a href="#sound-blaster">Sound Blaster</a> instead if available.</p>
				
				<table class="sound-configuration">
					<tr><th>I/O Address:</th><td>388</td></tr>
				</table>
