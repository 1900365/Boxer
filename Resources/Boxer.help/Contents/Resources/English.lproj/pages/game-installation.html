		<p class="tip">Always install games by dropping them onto the <a href="x-help-script://net.washboardabs.boxer.help/../shared/scripts/import.scpt?" rel="application-window">Import window</a> or the “Import a new game” droplet.<br>
		This runs the game’s installer if necessary and bundles the game into a new <a href="gameboxes.html" rel="topic">gamebox</a>.</p>

		<a name="game-installation-without-preamble"></a>
		<section class="no-border">
			<a name="install-location"></a>
			<h2>Telling the game where to install</h2>
		
			<p><strong>Choose any location on drive C</strong>. The path within drive C doesn’t matter, so use whatever the game suggests.</p>
			
			<p class="note">When importing a game, Boxer creates an empty drive C inside a new <a href="gameboxes.html" rel="topic">gamebox</a>.<br>
			Installing to drive C will put the game files directly into the gamebox, where they belong.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<a name="install-size"></a>
			<h2>Choosing an install size</h2>
			<p>Many CD-ROM games offer a choice of installation sizes, where smaller installations leave more data on the CD.</p>
			
			<p><strong>For most games you should choose the smallest install size</strong>, because Boxer will import the whole CD into the gamebox regardless. A larger install size wastes disk space and will have no effect on loading times.</p>
			
			<p class="note">Some games disable features or leave out content at smaller installation sizes.<br>
			You should choose the maximum size for those games.</p>

			<a name="soundcard-configuration"></a>
			<h2>Choosing a sound card</h2>
			
			<p>Many games will happily <strong>autodetect the correct sound card settings</strong>. If you need to choose a sound card manually, then Boxer supports the following:</p>
			
			<section>
				<a name="sound-blaster"></a>
				<h3>Sound Blaster/Pro/16</h3>
				<p>The most reliable choice and supported by almost all games. Choose Sound Blaster 16 if available, otherwise Pro or regular Sound Blaster. Use the following settings if asked:</p>
				
				<table class="sound-configuration">
					<tr><th>I/O Address:</th><td>220</td></tr>
					<tr><th>IRQ:</th><td>7</td></tr>
					<tr><th>DMA:</th><td>1</td></tr>
					<tr><th>High DMA:</th><td>5</td></tr>
				</table>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<a name="general-midi"></a>
				<h3>General MIDI <small>(“MPU-401 compatible”)</small></h3>
				<p>This provides high-quality music (better than <a href="#sound-blaster">Sound Blaster</a>) and is supported by most later DOS games. If the game lets you choose separate soundcards for digital audio and music, choose <strong>Sound Blaster 16 for digital audio</strong> and <strong>General MIDI for music</strong>.</p>
				
				<table class="sound-configuration">
					<tr><th>I/O Address:</th><td>330</td></tr>
				</table>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<a name="gravis-ultrasound"></a>
				<h3>Gravis Ultrasound/Max <small>(“GUS”)</small></h3>
				<p>Not widely supported: but in games that properly support it, this can provide more channels of digital audio and better sampled music than <a href="#sound-blaster">Sound Blaster</a> or <a href="#general-midi">General MIDI</a>.</p>
				
				<p class="note">If the game’s music card option is labelled “Gravis Ultrasound MIDI synth” then it doesn’t provide native Gravis Ultrasound music, and you should choose <a href="#general-midi">General MIDI</a> instead.</p>
				
				<table class="sound-configuration">
					<tr><th>I/O Address:</th><td>240</td></tr>
					<tr><th>IRQ:</th><td>5</td></tr>
					<tr><th>DMA:</th><td>3</td></tr>
				</table>
			</section>
		
			<section>
				<a name="adlib"></a>
				<h3>AdLib</h3>
				<p>This early music-only card became a de facto standard, and is supported by most DOS games. Choose <a href="#sound-blaster">Sound Blaster</a> instead if the game supports it.</p>
				
				<table class="sound-configuration">
					<tr><th>I/O Address:</th><td>388</td></tr>
				</table>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<a name="tandy-sound"></a>
				<h3>Disney Sound Source/Covox Speech Thing</small></h3>
				<p>A cheap sound peripheral that provided low-quality digital sound. Supported by some games and demos. Requires no extra configuration.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<a name="tandy-sound"></a>
				<h3>Tandy 3-voice sound</h3>
				<p><strong>Only available if the game is set to <a href="dosbox-configuration.html#configuration-machine-type" rel="topic">emulate a Tandy 1000 computer</a>.</strong> Provides synthesized music and speech, and is supported by many EGA-era DOS games.</p>
				
				<p class="note">Enabling Tandy graphics and sound emulation requires adding settings to a gamebox’s configuration file. See <a href="dosbox-configuration.html" rel="topic">DOSBox Configuration</a> for details.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<a name="pc-speaker"></a>
				<h3>PC speaker</h3>
				<p>Boxer emulates the tinny little “beeper speaker” included in every DOS-era PC. Requires no configuration and is always available as a last resort, but choose anything else if you can.</p>
				
				<div class="note">
					<p>PC speaker sound is very dependent on the CPU speed: you may need to press <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> while playing to bring up the <a href="x-help-script://net.washboardabs.boxer.help/../shared/scripts/openinspector.scpt?CPU" rel="application-window">CPU Inspector</a>, and adjust the CPU speed slider until the game sounds right.</p>
					
					<p>(If you do, then <a href="mailto:support@boxerapp.com?subject=Custom%20game%20settings" rel="email">let me know the right speed</a> so Boxer can configure that game automatically in future.)</p>
